1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,510
Human advancement knows no boundary.

2
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:14,460
But this has not been without its price.

3
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:27,863
Though we stand at the height of prosperity…

4
00:00:28,314 --> 00:00:31,818
We need only look to the past to remember…

5
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,460
...That Nature is a power that cannot be ignored.

6
00:00:45,063 --> 00:00:48,840
Consuming even the mightiest empires…

7
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,462
And causing the greatest among us

8
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:59,848
... to tremble in her fury.

9
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,423
Yet from adversity the human spirit endures…

10
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:18,748
Finding ways to coexist with the Earth…

11
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:28,552
Or bend it to our cause.

12
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:36,980
Pursuing a course beyond distant horizons...

13
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:42,982
and revealing paths…

14
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:49,414
...both towards innovation..

15
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,611
And unintended catastrophe.

16
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:11,678
Our survival necessitates new solutions to old problems.

17
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:21,416
To ensure a future both for ourselves and generations to come…

18
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:28,315
United in purpose, we must now look beyond borders.

19
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:35,819
And welcome the dawn of the next era in human civilization.
