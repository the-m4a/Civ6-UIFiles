1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:04,970
From your earliest desire to live in peace…

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,210
... To the times when you stood against aggression…

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,410
…you have always sought cooperation.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,620
You did not do this merely to brighten your own glory …

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,620
...But because dignity, belongs to each of us.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:27,310
And in so doing, you have proved that your ancient 
and eternal commitment to a shared peace…

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,320
will be the foundation, of the world of tomorrow.
