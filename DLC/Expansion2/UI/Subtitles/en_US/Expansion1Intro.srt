1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:12,620
Daughter, the path has not always been easy
but you have never faltered.

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,030
Ours is a journey that spans generations.
Where one story ends,

3
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,510
another begins...

4
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,160
The world our ancestors faced was brutal...

5
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,670
...yet from it they drew life.

6
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,160
And though the road to prosperity
was at times harsh...

7
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:50,806
From it great civilizations arose...

8
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:06,461
As well as those who would oppose them.

9
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,340
With dreams of conquest of their own.

10
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:24,243
Creating mighty empires.

11
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:30,594
If only to see them fall.

12
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:48,614
Yet from the ashes of the old,
new possibilities arise...

13
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:56,672
You need only persevere.

14
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:12,769
For united mankind is capable of many things.

15
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:14,777
Both great...

16
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:24,364
And terrible.

17
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:35,319
Still, the true power to shape this world
has always lain in your hands.

18
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:46,531
Choose well.

19
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,828
Always.
